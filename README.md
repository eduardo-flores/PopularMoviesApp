If you want more detail about a specific movie you can touch on the movie image and see the details.

## Setup

After cloning the project it is necessary to setup the project with your own API Key from [The Movie DB](https://www.themoviedb.org/)

More information about how to generate the API Key [API Documentation](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction)

Once you have an API Key you need to change the file `/gradle.properties` with your API Key

    $ moviedb_apikey="Paste_the_api_key_here"
